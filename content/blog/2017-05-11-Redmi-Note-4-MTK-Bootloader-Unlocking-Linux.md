After long and tedious process of unlocking bootloader in my Xiaomi Redmi Note 4
phone using linux, to sum up I decided to write *definitive* tutorial about it.
I have collected all information that were scattered around internet and
gathered them in one place.

## Note
This tutorial is written especially for MTK SOC devices, so if you have locked
bootlader on other Xiaomi phone that Redmi Note 4 and it is MTK, then you can
try unlocking it using tools and methods presented here.

## General information
Probably many of you knows that
[bootloader unlocking process](http://en.miui.com/thread-202290-1-1.html)
in recent Xiaomi phones is difficult and requires a lot of work.
First of all it requires special tool called Mi Unlock. Unfortunately it works
only in Windows operating system. Second thing is that to unlock bootloader you
must [ask for premission](https://miui.com/unlock/) first. Then you need to
wait for SMS message that you are allowed to proceed to next steps. To sum up
this part - **we will need to use Windows operating system anyway**.
Right now there is no way to unlock bootloader using linux only :(
So install one
on physical machine or virtual one.

## Before you start
To make sure that bootloader in your Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 MTK is actually locked
we will use Android Fastboot tool.

- Install Android tools in your system (search for **android-tools** in
        package manager)
- Turn off your phone
- Press and hold **Volume (-)** and **Power** buttons **together**.
    Relase buttons when Fastboot screen appears.
- Connect your phone to linux PC
- Issue following command to check if device is connected:
    {{< highlight sh >}}fastboot devices{{< / highlight >}}

    Non empty list of fastboot devices should appear
- Issue next command to check if bootloader is locked:
    {{< highlight sh >}}fastboot getvar unlocked{{< / highlight >}}
    If you get status like:
    {{< highlight sh >}}unlocked: "no"{{< / highlight >}}
    that means you need to unlock, so continue reading tutorial.

    If this appears:
    {{< highlight sh >}}unlocked: "yes"{{< / highlight >}}
    then you don't need to do anything.


## Unlocking process
### Preparation

    - Go to <https://account.xiaomi.com/>

my vary between users.

    <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9wtW2KGOf0RYWhLNG9ybWM3OG8>
    and download old version of Mi Flash tool. This is needed for bypass
    possible error saying that **binding time is too short**.
- Install application in windows machine or go to next section where I
  described process of preparing virtual machine.

### Using Virtual Machine instead of physical Windows PC
- Install Virtual Box via package manager
- Create new Virtual Machine and install Windows on it (I recommend using Windows
  7)

  running, click on **Devices -> Install Guest Addons**. Finish installation
  inside
  virtual machine.

    - If not then install manually
        - Download <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>
        - Launch virtual box
        - Go to File -> Preferences -> Extensions
        - Click on small orange button and select downloaded file
        - Go through install wizard steps and finally provide root password for
          installation completion
        - Restart virtual box
- Go to your virtual machine settings
- Select USB
- Check **Enable USB Controller**
- Select **USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller**
- Click on small blue icon
- *New Filter 1* position will appear on list
- Make sure new filter is checked
- You can test if USB is working by plugging USB Stick to your PC while virtual
  machine is running. It should appear inside VM.
- If everything is working install Mi Flash on virtual machine

minutes. This is normal.

    you are asked to do so.

    will be unlocked** (you can verify this by using fastboot tool method
            described at beginning of tutorial).
- Enjoy!

## What to do next ?
Now when you have your bootloader unlocked you will probably want to **flash
custom Recovery** to manage your ROMS. This process will be described in
[next post]({{< relref "installing-and-using-TWRP-Recovery.md" >}}).
