After long 3 years break I am back to blogging. A lot of thing have changed and happened and I am in completely different
moment in my IT carrier. I have finished University and started to focus on DevOps related topics. From now I will be
blogging on https://www.iops.tech. On my blog you will find mix of Linux / SysAdmin and programming stuff. I will focus on
explaining all things as precise as possible. I hope that my blog will become place where I will improve my DevOps
skills by teaching other people what I know. Stay tuned for new content coming soon in 2021.
